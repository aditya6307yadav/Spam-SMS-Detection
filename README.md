# Spam-SMS-Detection
This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Legitimate (Ham). It incorporates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques to build an effective spam detection system. By using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Word Embeddings for feature extraction, the model captures meaningful patterns from the text. Various machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are implemented and evaluated to identify the most accurate approach.
The dataset used for this project is the , which contains labeled examples of spam and legitimate messages. The project also includes an evaluation pipeline using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust model performance. Built using Python, this project leverages powerful libraries like Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, and NumPy. It offers a practical approach to detecting and filtering spam messages, making it a valuable tool for improving communication experiences.
